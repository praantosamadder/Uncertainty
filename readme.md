The only reason this file exists is because it makes this repo sound cool.

I honestly don't know what license this falls under so if you think you know better, then hit me up!

This code was never written with "readability" in mind so if you don't understand what a particular line does, then I probally don't myself either. But then again, this is JavaScript and JavaScript code is supposed to be shit so why not?
